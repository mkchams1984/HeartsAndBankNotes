<div class="read-content"><p id="intro">This blog is about my decision to give up an exciting, and promising career to give love a chance. But being the ambitious person that I am, I‘m determined not to completely forget about success. So the purpose of this blog is to document my journey while I try to find the perfect balance of both. Because let’s face it…I’m greedy, and I want it all. Hell, I deserve it all. So do you, and everyone else in this world. After all, what is success if you have no one to enjoy it with?</p>

        <p>Hello to all the love junkies, and blog aficionados out there. I apologize in advance for the delay in posting, but honestly, who could have planned for the wild ride I’m about to take you on? But before we begin any of that, I need to get you up to speed.
        </p>
    
<p> Kyle, and I started talking February of this year. We met on an app that I had downloaded, and quickly hit it off. I found him to be everything my ex was not. Sweet, charming, communicative, open, brooding, organized, sensible, genuine, loving, and a master in the kitchen…just to name a few. </p>

<p>Our backgrounds are completely different. I was born in Detroit Michigan, and had traveled the world with my family at an early age. I have family sprinkled in different regions all over the world, and (apart from my mother) am not awfully attached to any of them. In the middle of 2006 at the age of 22 I packed my life into a couple of carry on bags, booked a flight from Virginia to Las Vegas, and never looked back. </p>

<p>Kyle on the other hand was born, and raised in Northern California. The vast majority of his family also live in Northern California, and although he has done some traveling he's pretty much stayed within the confines of the country. </p>

<p>But somehow, despite our different backgrounds we both ended up in the same place in life on a parallel plane. 
In September of this year after coming to the startling realization that I hadn’t been outside of Las Vegas city limits in over five years I decided I needed to break free. So I took some time off work, and drove for over 10 hours to meet Kyle face to face for the first time. </p>

<p>
Needless to say it was the most magical two days of my life, and all I could think about once I was back home was how much I missed him. My upper middle class nest egg I had built for myself in a city that everyone loves (or loves to hate) meant nothing to me anymore. All I could see was the misery that I had become numb to because I thought I had no choice. At that point I made a six month plan to get all my affairs in order, and move to Northern California. </p>

<p>Then the month of November rolled around, and Kyle came to Las Vegas for a visit. Although Las Vegas has an endless amount of things to do we really just enjoyed our time together for that weekend. Then he left, and all I knew is that I could no longer tolerate the gloominess that loomed over me when he was not around. So I arranged for a friend to take over the lease to my apartment, put in my two weeks notice at my job that I loved, and told my ex who was still living with me that he had to go. On the 27th of November I packed up as much of my stuff that I could fit in my mid sized sedan, and did all I could to prepare my cat for a long road trip. </p></div>

<div class="read-content"><p>My poor feline child cried until we hit the Southern California border. But by the time we got to Bakersfield she was more curious than anything. </p>

<p>By 7:00 PM we were both over each other. Alice was demanding to get out of the carrier, and I had taken a wrong exit on the freeway, and had to turn around. But we finally made it. I was exhausted. But she was restless, and ready to explore her new surroundings. I kept telling myself that the hardest part was over even though I knew better. Unpacking was going to be a bitch, and even the thought of it made my body want to give out. All I wanted to do was lay in bed next to Kyle, and let our energies converge. Which is precisely what I did. </p></div>

        <p>My second day in my new life, and Kyle had to go to work. I decided not to let the day go to waste. I started with my daily dose of caffeine, and my morning cigarette on the balcony.  Breathing in the brisk air, and enjoying the natural greenery (something sorely amiss in Las Vegas unless you live in one of the super affluent neighborhoods). The entire time, my left brain still sending signals that I’m making all the wrong choices. Logic is the one thing that has helped me survive when times were tough. It was extremely hard to go against what I considered to be a trusted, ethereal friend  for all these years. Things like <q>It’s not too late to turn back,</q> and  <q>Remember the promise you made all those years ago to never let your emotions possess you to do anything stupid? Well, what the hell do you think this is?</q> <q>When have I ever steered you wrong?!</q> my sense of logic desperately screamed.</p>
        <p>I thought back to a time before where my emotional, and logical minds were battling it out. The moment I thought my logical mind had actually killed my emotional mind. Well Mr. Emotion? If you’ve taken me ten hours away from home you can’t be dead. So what’s your rebuttal? </p>
        <p>At that moment, I saw two squirrels playing together, chasing each other around the trunk of the tree in my immediate view. Suddenly I felt a moment of child like wonder. This feeling of carefree, wild abandon in my heart. I could feel my logical mind quietly accepting defeat. This was real, and there was no turning back. </p></div>

        <p><q>Alright,</q> said Mr. Logic. <q>If you’re really going to do this you’d better start hunting for jobs tomorrow.</q></p></div>

        <p>Hello all. So today is a day worth celebrating!</p>
        <p>After busting ass, and applying for over 30 jobs in the last week, I finally got a promising email asking that I do a phone interview! So exciting, and so well deserved after receiving both a <q>yes</q> and a <q>no</q> email from another company yesterday spaced about five minutes apart. Not to mention a rejection letter I received from another company (not two hours after submitting my application) that sounded so nasty that I seriously wondered how long I would have lasted at the company if I had gotten the job.</p>
        
        <p>I also finally got all the technical issues I was experiencing with Postmates resolved so that I could start driving, and making some cash on the side!</p>
        
        <p>Although Kyle never really had high hopes for the Postmates gig he was ecstatic to hear the news about my upcoming phone interview. Thereby reaffirming his genuine loving care for my overall well being. My mother was excited as well. But in her old age, explaining certain details that most would consider insignificant drained me of my burst of energy. But not until I did one round of happy-dancing around the apartment. </p></div>

        <h6 class="pic-talk">Truth be told, she has a heart of gold.</h6>
        
        <div class="read-content"><p>Considering I had no money to actually go out, and celebrate (and no one to do it with since Kyle was at work) I decided to get back on the computer to apply for more  jobs. Then making a conscious effort to not over exert myself with one myopic task all day jumped on Kahn Academy to continue growing my sorely minimal web design skills.</p></div>

        <h6 class="pic-talk"><q>I'll help you find a job, Daddy.</q></h6>
        
        <div class="read-content"><p>I of course also had to make sure that Kyle came home to a clean, and pleasant smelling home. After all, what kind of significant other would I be if I only cared about myself?</p>
        
        <p>In other news Alice, and Helen (the felines), are warming up to each other quite well. I already knew it wouldn’t be much of a problem for Alice since she’s been subjected to other cats almost her entire life. But I was deathly afraid of how Helen would react to another cat coming into her territory, and although there have been a couple of snags it’s been a really smooth transition overall. It’s like we’ve become our own little Modern Family.</p>
        
        <p>Until next time…Cheers.</p></div>

        <h6>Posted on 12/24/2016</h6>

        <p>Hello everyone.</p>
<p>So what <em>hasn’t</em> happened since the last post? For one, I have done a few deliveries with Postmates. I must say it is an enjoyable way to make some pocket change. It’s nice to get out of the house, and meet new people while getting to know where all the great places to eat are. This would have been a dream job when I was in my 20s. When I was all about the hustle, and bustle of city life.  The one complaint I have would be that the all the business seems to be in the downtown area, so parking would have to be the hardest part of the job. But then again, I have been seriously slacking on exercise so that’s probably a blessing in disguise.</p>

<p>Fortunately I shouldn’t have to rely on pocket change as my main source of income for too much longer though. I absolutely crushed my phone interview, as well as my video interview, and grammar test. Although that last one wasn’t much of a surprise. After finding out I did well, and that they wanted to invite me to an interview/orientation this coming Friday I jumped up, and down to the point where I hurt my ankle. Initially I thought I somehow hit my funny bone. But later that night it began to feel worse than it did initially, and began to swell up. It still feels a tad achy as I’m writing this. But after putting some ice on it the following day I’m happy to say I’ll be back to normal in no time at all.</p>


<p>Where has Kyle been throughout all my happy moments, and unfortunate accidents? I’m pleased to say he’s been right by my side. Supporting me every step of the way. At one point he actually needed some financial help from me for a Christmas party with his co-workers, and it felt wonderful to be able to say <q>yes.</q> What didn’t feel so good was when he forced me to face my debts. The ones on my credit that I’ve been successfully ignoring all this time. I don’t really consider myself a deadbeat, but when you don’t have enough money to pay said debts it tends to be pretty depressing being reminded of them all the time. But I want my life with Kyle to be not only prosperous, but honest. So I guess emptying my sack of shit to lighten the load is going to be necessary in order to accomplish that.</p></div>

<h6 class="pic-talk">He doesn't really like this photo. You never saw this.</h6>

<div class="read-content"><p>Speaking of sacks of shit, it seems as though there is no end to the prior chapter in my life. Forgetting to give my desk key back to my boss before I left the last company I work for was a minor occurrence, easily resolved with an envelope, and a couple of postage stamps. But I was certain that the terms of the lease I had signed before moving would be fulfilled by my friends. Especially considering the fact that they were the ones who had the idea. That come to find out after a FaceTime call is not the case, and so I immediately added another $2800 to my overall debt in anticipation of the collection notices that will soon be rolling in. In all honesty it’s totally my fault. Kim at the leasing office asked me at the time that my friend signed if I wanted to be taken off, and I said <q>no</q> just in case I would end up having to go back to Las Vegas. Looking back I can’t say why I thought I would have to, but every part of me was telling me that I would need that safety net just in case. Now that safety net has become a real pain in my ass, and there’s not even going to be a <q>next time</q> so that I can put the lesson I learned into action. Oh well, onto happier topics of discussion…</p></div>

<h6 class="pic-talk">A great meal always makes tbe day better.</h6>

<div class="read-content"><p>The fear of meeting Kyle’s immediate family is over, and I must say those fears were ultimately absurd. His mother, although a bit eccentric has a beautiful spirit. His father, and brothers down to earth. One of them, along with his wife made us an absolutely exquisite breakfast for our visit for which I cannot thank them enough. Now I just have to prepare myself for the upcoming Christmas party where his extended family will be present. Wish me luck!</p></div>
